# EchoCircle 
### A Secure, Private Mental Health Support Platform

EchoCircle is a privacy-first mental health platform designed to enable
anonymous peer support, self-help resources, and therapist discovery
— without AI-driven personalization, behavioral tracking, or surveillance.

The platform emphasizes **human connection, emotional safety, and user control**
through encrypted communication, temporary peer groups, and offline-first tools.
